# jacobians
This MAGMA Code can compute simple factors including multiplicity of an abelian variety over a finite field given it's L-Polynomial (i.e., the nominator of the Hasse-Weil-zeta function).
Furthermore, we provide an algorithm that compute the L-Polynomial of Jacobians, associated to curves that correspond to certain Carlitz-Cyclotomic field extensions.
